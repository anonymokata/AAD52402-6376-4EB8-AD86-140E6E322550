The libcheck libraries are needed to build.
To install libcheck on Ubuntu 14.04: 
```
    sudo apt-get install check
```
My submission is on branch master. Other branches are me playing around.

To build the library and the test executable:
```
    make
```
Or, to build everything and run the tests:
```
    make test
```
The continuous integration jobs for this can be found at:
