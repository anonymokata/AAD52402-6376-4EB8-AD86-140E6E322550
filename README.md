# Roman Numeral Calculator

Obviously the check libraries are needed.

My submission is on branch master. Any other branch is me just playing around.

To build the library and the test executable run "make" in the root source directory.

The tests executable will be generated at tests/romanNumeralTests


Any questions should be directed to wguynes@pillartechnology.com
